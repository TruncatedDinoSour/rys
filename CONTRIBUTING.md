- **DO NOT** commit to the python script, it will get removed
- If you are adding a new editor or modifying already existing one:
  - Add your configuration/syntax/... File to `/editor/` directory
  - Add an entry to [README.md](/README.md) `Editor support` section
- If you are editing any other scripts:
  - Make sure they pass linting (for example shellcheck for shell and bash scripts)
